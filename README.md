## ✨ Features

| Terminal (TUI) | Mobile Web |
|----------------|------------|
| Real-time session monitoring | Monitor from your smartphone |
| Quick tab focus with keyboard | Remote terminal focus |
| Vim-style navigation | Send messages to terminal |
| Simple status display | Real-time sync via WebSocket |

- 🔌 **Serverless** - File-based state management, no API server required
- ⚡ **Easy Setup** - One command `ccm` for automatic setup and launch
- 🔒 **Secure** - No external data transmission, token-based mobile auth

---

## 📋 Requirements

> **Note**: This tool is **macOS only** due to its use of AppleScript for terminal control.

- **macOS**
- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0
- **Claude Code** installed

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run with npx (no install required)

```bash
npx claude-code-monitor
```

### Or install globally

```bash
npm install -g claude-code-monitor
ccm
```

On first run, it automatically sets up hooks and launches the monitor.

### Mobile Access

1. Press `h` to show QR code (default port: 3456)
2. Scan with your smartphone (same Wi-Fi required)

> If port 3456 is in use, an available port is automatically selected.

### Remote Access with Tailscale

Access from anywhere using [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) (secure VPN).

**Prerequisites:**
1. Install Tailscale on your Mac and smartphone
2. Sign in with the same Tailscale account on both devices
3. Ensure Tailscale is connected (check menu bar icon)

```bash
# Start with Tailscale IP
npx claude-code-monitor -t

# Or if installed globally
ccm -t
```

With `-t` option, the QR code URL uses your Tailscale IP (100.x.x.x), allowing access from any device in your Tailnet - even outside your local network.

> **Security**: Tailscale uses WireGuard encryption. Communication is secure even over public networks.

## 📱 Mobile Web Interface

Monitor and control Claude Code sessions from your smartphone.

### Features

- Real-time session status via WebSocket
- View latest Claude messages
- Focus terminal sessions remotely
- Send text messages to terminal (multi-line supported)
- Swipe-to-close gesture on modal
- Warning display for dangerous commands

### Security

> **Important**: Your smartphone and Mac must be on the **same Wi-Fi network** (or use Tailscale with `-t` option for remote access).

- **Token Authentication** - A unique token is generated for authentication
- **Local Network Only** - Not accessible from the internet
- **Do not share the URL** - Treat it like a password

**Recommended networks:**
- Home Wi-Fi
- Office/Work Wi-Fi

> **Warning**: Avoid using on public Wi-Fi networks (cafes, airports, etc.). Other users on the same network could potentially access your monitor.

## 🖥️ Supported Terminals

| Terminal | Focus Support | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| iTerm2 | ✅ Full | TTY-based window/tab targeting |
| Terminal.app | ✅ Full | TTY-based window/tab targeting |
| Ghostty | ✅ Full | Title-based window targeting via Window menu |

> Other terminals can use monitoring, but focus feature is not supported.

### Ghostty Users

For reliable focus functionality with multiple tabs, `ccm` or `ccm setup` will prompt you to add the following setting:

```json
// ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_TERMINAL_TITLE": "1"
  }
}
```

This prevents Claude Code from overwriting terminal titles, which is necessary for tab identification in Ghostty.

If you skipped this during setup and want to enable it later, add the setting manually or delete `CLAUDE_CODE_MONITOR_GHOSTTY_ASKED` from your settings and run `ccm` again.

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Sessions not showing

1. Run `ccm setup` to verify hook configuration
2. Check `~/.claude/settings.json` for hook settings
3. Restart Claude Code

### Focus not working

1. Verify you're using a supported terminal
2. Check System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
   - Ensure your terminal app has Accessibility permission

### Reset data

```bash
ccm clear
```

---

## 🔒 Security

> **Warning**: Without Tailscale, this tool is designed for use on **trusted private networks only**.
>
> **Never use on public Wi-Fi** (cafes, airports, hotels, co-working spaces, etc.) without Tailscale.
> Other users on the same network could potentially intercept the authentication token
> and gain control of your terminal sessions, including the ability to execute arbitrary commands.

- **No data sent to external servers** - All data stays on your machine
- Hook registration modifies `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Focus feature uses AppleScript for terminal control
- Mobile Web uses token authentication on local network only
- Server-side validation blocks dangerous shell commands

### Secure Remote Access

For secure access from outside your local network, use the `-t` (Tailscale) option:

| Mode | Network | Security |
|------|---------|----------|
| Default | Same Wi-Fi only | Home/Office Wi-Fi recommended |
| `-t` (Tailscale) | Anywhere in Tailnet | WireGuard encrypted, safe on any network |

With Tailscale, communication is encrypted end-to-end, making it safe to use even on public Wi-Fi (cafes, airports, etc.).

## 📦 Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { getSessions, focusSession } from 'claude-code-monitor';
